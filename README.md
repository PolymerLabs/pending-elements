pending-elements
================

Staging repository for holding and tracking externally-submitted pending elements, before they are integrated into the core-, paper-, or other Polymer-vended element set.

The Polymer team and community loves new element contributions! We're always looking for new elements to add to the `paper-*` and `core-*` element sets, and this repository is central to our process for integrating new elements into the official sets.

If you're interested in building an element but not sure what you should build, check out the issues in this repo tagged with [help wanted](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/pending-elements/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ahelp-wanted). 

To submit an element for review for inclusion into the paper- or core- element sets:
* Sign the [Google CLA](https://cla.developers.google.com)
* Create a github repo for your new element.
* Create a PR to this repository adding your element to `bower.json` and `pending-elements.html`.
* The Polymer team will review your element for both code and design, and leave issues if changes are needed.
* Feel free to send an email to [polymer-dev@googlegroups.com](mailto:polymer-dev@googlegroups.com) to get feedback on your element.
